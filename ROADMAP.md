1. Test coverage
2. Explore requiring Vue Router in order to hook into `beforeEach` and target the native back/forward browser functions
3. Explore if any internal changes are necessary to allow for custom transitions based on to/from route
  - For instance, a profile picture that moves from center on `/profile` to left on `/profile/overview`, but on all other route changes simply fades
4. Include version compatibility
5. Test in more browsers (notably Edge, IE)
